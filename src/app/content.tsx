                    <p>Currently, I am a software developer II at rain engineering. I was one of three react developers that took our product from the beginning to going live in a plant in Europe in just 7 months.</p>
                    <p>Prior to this i workde for Collette Health, where we used Laravel and Vue.js to build and continiouly improve a video monitoring application in hospitals.</p>

                    <p>At Rain Engineering, I played a key role in developing and deploying a full-scale manufacturing application in just seven months. I contributed to UX/UI design and front-end development, translating Figma wireframes into functional components and leading features like "Batch History" and "Comingle Modal." I helped implement a security system, optimized workflows across five manufacturing plants, and streamlined API integrations with SwaggerUI. During deployment in the Netherlands, I provided on-site support to ensure a smooth transition. Additionally, I earned a Plant Administration certification, leveraging GEâ€™s software suite to enhance front-end solutions and workflow efficiency.</p>

                    <p>At Collette Health, I collaborated in an agile team to develop a responsive design and build 15+ reusable Vue components. I helped transition legacy code from jQuery to Vue.js with the Composition API and Tailwind CSS while mentoring junior developers on frontend standards. Additionally, I implemented unit testing, resolved 32+ bugs, and enhanced security to meet NIST standards. I also streamlined version control and code reviews using GitKraken and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and maintainable codebase.</p>
